				<li class="updates"> [<b>Dec 2018</b>] Network Analysis can be used to understand <a href=https://hbr.org/2018/11/better-people-analytics target="_blank">Social Dynamics within an Organization</a>. The email networks, social networks and communication pattern can reveal informaion about the organization structure, its efficiency, team dynamics and productivity. In the following report, <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/reports/CS224W-2018-58.pdf" target="_blank">Analyzing and Mitigating Phishing Outbreaks: a Case Study on the 2016 DNC Email Network </a>, we used temporal information from a corporate email network to detect social hierarchy and social groups within an organization.

				<li class="updates"> [<b>Jun 2019</b>] Precision medicine, an emerging field of medicine, has enabled prospects of customization ofhealthcare, medical decisions and treatments tailored to individual patients.The use of genomic andtranscriptomic biomarkers as well as other multi-omics data has played a major role in precision oncology.Concurrent with the explosion of clinically relevant molecular data, the application of machine learningmethods to multi-omics datasets has become more commonplace. In this paper, <a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2019spr/report/58.pdf"> Combining Multi-Omics Data to Predict Overall Survival of Breast Cancer Patients </a>, we present a novel methodof combining multi-omics datasets to predict breast cancer patientsâ€™ overall survival

				<li class="updates"> [<b>Jun 2018</b>] Prescribing drugs for off-label uses is a common practice in medicine. Drugs have been repositioned via mining clinical data, applying statistical tools, and leveraging molecular information. Computational analysis of Biomedical Knowledge allows us to discover new uses for existing drugs on the market. In this report, <a "href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MzPzLcRGla7V-RnVLo39oKjqZ1agSJcq/view?usp=sharing">Predicting Disease treatments from Biomedical Knowledge Graph Data </a>, we focus on the problem of predicting whether a given drug can treat a given disease. We examined different mechanisms of creating a metapath-based models to predict drug-disease relations using information encoded in a Biomedical Knowledge Graph.
